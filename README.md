# CaptchaRecog
CaptchaRecog is an open source project dedicated to recognize different captcha using machine learning models. Captchas are widely used on websites to prevent automated bots and spam, but they can also be an obstacle for legitimate users. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for recognizing and bypassing captchas.
